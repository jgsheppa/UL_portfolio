### James Sheppard

My name is James and I live in Vienna, Austria. I am currently training to become a web developer, and I previously studied philosophy and literature and Knox College, in Galesburg, IL, and The University of Vienna in Austria. My interests lie in natural and computer languages, translation, and the intersection of philosophy and art.

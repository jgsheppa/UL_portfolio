### James Sheppard

My name is James and I live in Vienna, Austria. I am currently training to become a web developer. Previously, I studied philosophy and literature at Knox College, in Galesburg, IL, and The University of Vienna in Austria. My interests lie in natural and computer languages, translation, and the intersection of philosophy and art.
